Building on the success
of the container-based development model, it provides the tools to operate containers reliably at
scale. The container-based development methodology is popular outside just the realm of open source

faster development cycles, portability and consistent operation - apply to applications targeting the

on Linux - a hybrid cluster. Production-level support for running a Windows node was introduced
with <a href=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/25/kubernetes-1-14-release-announcement/>version 1.14 of Kubernetes back in March 2019</a>, so in terms of deployment of Windows containers, operators can expect exactly the same features for Windows workloads as they do for Linux ones.</p><p>The Kubernetes components that are required for a worker node are:</p><ul><li><p>kubelet: this is the Kubernetes agent which manages and reports on the running containers in a pod.</p></li><li><p>kube-proxy: a network proxy component which maintains the network rules and allows pods to

MicroK8s is a minimal implementation of Kubernetes which can run on the average laptop, yet has production
grade features. It's great for offline development, prototyping and testing, and if required you can also
get professional support for it through <a href=https://ubuntu.com/support>Ubuntu Advantage</a>.</p><p>The most compelling feature of MicroK8s for this use case is that you can run it sort-of-almost-natively
on Windows 10! For development work and even production use-cases, this is hugely useful - your hybrid
cluster can reside on one physical Windows machine. MicroK8s on Windows works by making use of
<a href=https://multipass.run/>Multipass</a> - a neat way of running a virtual Ubuntu machine on Windows.
The MicroK8s installer for Windows doesn't require any knowledge of multi-pass or even virtual machines
though, it sets everything up with just a few options from the installer.</p><p>To fetch the current installer and see the (simple!) install instructions for MicroK8s on Windows, check out the <a href=https://microk8s.io/>MicroK8s website</a>.</p><p>Whether using MicroK8 on Windows or a separate Linux machine, the next thing to consider is networking. Calico has been the default CNI(Container Network Interface) for MicroK8s since the 1.19 release. The CNI handles a number of networking requirements:</p><ul><li><p>Container-to-container communications</p></li><li><p>Pod-to-Pod communications</p></li><li><p>Pod-to-Service communications</p></li><li><p>External-to-Service communications</p></li></ul><p>The popularity of Calico has been building for some time over simpler CNIs, as it supports
more useful features (e.g. Border Gateway Protocol [#ref]) and is also available in a
<a href=https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico-enterprise/>supported enterprise version</a>.</p><p>Usefully, Calico already bundles the Windows executables for this CNI in an installer script that also fetches the other components required for a Windows node, making installation and setup that much easier. The Calico website has <a href=https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/windows-calico/quickstart>complete instructions for this</a>. This contains not only links to the installer script but also a detailed rationale on how the setup works. If you are just interested in getting started with adding a Windows worker with MicroK8s there are more concise and specific instructions in the <a href=https://microk8s.io/docs/add-a-windows-worker-node-to-microk8s>MicroK8s documentation</a>.</p><h3 id=scheduling-windows-containers-on-hybrid-kubernetes>Scheduling Windows containers on hybrid Kubernetes</h3><p>The final step of this journey is to actually deploy some Windows containers.
