# k8s-crew


This is the temporary blog site. There are things still to be done, but it works and is currently deployed
using netlify:  <https://vigorous-euler-k8s.netlify.app/>

To add a new post, you currently need to make a new file in 

`content/en/blog/_posts/`

You can probably do this [by clicking this link](https://github.com/evilnick/k8s-crew/new/main/content/en/blog/_posts)

This should include some basic frontmatter:


```
---
title: "Hello K8s Crew"
date: 2021-04-26T11:37:04+01:00
draft: false
---


If you want to test deploy yourself, just clone the repo and run:

```
hugo serve
```

then go to the link in the output
