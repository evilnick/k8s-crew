#### MicroK8s

MicroK8s is the smallest, fastest, fully-conformant Kubernetes that tracks upstream releases and makes
clustering trivial. MicroK8s is great for offline development, prototyping, and testing. Use it on a
VM as a small, cheap, reliable k8s for CI/CD. Itâ€™s also the best production grade Kubernetes for
appliances. Develop IoT apps for k8s and deploy them to MicroK8s on your Linux boxes.

#### Charmed Kubernetes

Architectural freedom. Fully automated operations. Extensible Kubernetes for all.
Kubernetes on Ubuntu gives you perfect portability of workloads across all infrastructures, from the datacentre to the public cloud. With a strong focus on AI/ML and providing a cloud-native platform for the enterprise, Ubuntu is the platform of choice for K8s.

Deep integration with infrastructure features such as LBaaS, storage, and networking means freedom and preservation of choice in infrastructure.
