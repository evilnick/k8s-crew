{{/* 

This shortcode lists pages that have a "feature" section configured in front matter. 

This creates a set of feature boxes as seen on the home page.

See /content/en/docs/concepts/services-networking/service.md for an example:

feature:
  title: Service discovery and load balancing
  description: >
    No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives containers their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of containers, and can load-balance across them.

Note that markdown can be used in the description.
